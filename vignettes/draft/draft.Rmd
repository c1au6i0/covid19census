# Introduction

In the mist of a virus pandemic, unraveling the constant flow of epidemiological data is of paramount importance, not only to  guide the implementation and evaluation of non-pharmacological interventions, but also to optimize drug development. 

* Examples of epdidemiological alone or + dother data guiding interventions:  
[@kissler2020s]: proposed non pharmacological intervention

[@wu2020m]: correlation p2.5

[BCG](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/bacille-calmette-gu%C3%A9rin-(bcg)-vaccination-and-covid-19): clinical trial on BCG

**We need data banks, repositories of aggregated data**

* Examples of that and databanks of epidemiological as well as genetic data.
 [The traking project](https://covidtracking.com/)

* Examples of R package [ccdcovidview](https://feedly.com/i/entry/bdiQAD3fuPUMyDNqrmPKRt6BvYW45zeCOcg+AUEj5wM=_1716a5b8395:28a35fb:7f4666f4)


Boom our package


#  Implementation

A family of `get` functions is employed by the package to extract updated time-series data dynamically from different on-line sources.

For **U.S** the prefix of the function is `getus_` follow by the specific metric of interest:

  * `getus_covid`: extracts data of COVID-19 from the [New York Time git repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
  * `getus_dex`: extracts data of DEX, an [activity indexes](https://github.com/COVIDExposureIndices/COVIDExposureIndices) calculated  by  Victor Couture, Jonathan Dingel, Allison Green, Jessie Handbury, and Kevin Williams based on smartphone movement data provided by `PlaceIQ`.
  * `getus_tests`: extract info regarding number of tests performed, their results and hospitalization from the repository of [the Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/api}).
  * `getus_all`: executes all the above functions and join the results with other datasets statically contained in the package.

For **Italy**, the prefix of the function is `getit_` followed by `covid` or `all`.

  * `getit_covid`: extracts data of COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations and tests from the [Protezione Civle]( "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/master/dati-regioni/dpc-covid19-ita-regioni.csv").
  * `getit_all`: executes the above function and join the results with other datasets statically contained in the package.
  
  
  


# Discussion

For U.S.,data regarding COVID-19 number of cases and deaths (at the county level) were obtained from a repository mantained by the [New York Time](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), whereas number of tests and hospitalizations (at the state level) thefrom the [the Covid Tracking Project].
